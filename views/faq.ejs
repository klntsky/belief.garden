<h1>What are Core Beliefs?</h1>

Core beliefs are beliefs that characterize you as a person. You can pick up to 20 of them by clicking the star symbol on a card. The piechart in your profile can be adjusted to express how much each of the core beliefs is important to you. The importance level of each belief must lie within 2% - 90% interval.
