<h1>What are Core Beliefs?</h1>

Core beliefs are beliefs that characterize you as a person. You can pick up to 20 of them by clicking the star symbol on a card.<br><br>
The piechart in your profile can be adjusted to express how much each of the core beliefs is important to you. The importance level of each belief must lie within 2% - 90% interval.

<h1>How to participate in debates?</h1>

Debates are enabled by default (<a href="/settings">disable</a>)<br>

Users can only post one reply in a row.<br>

Every user can delete their own replies, and profile owners can delete replies under their comments.<br>

Replies are always public.

<h1>How to restrict other users from replying?</h1>

Profile owners can ban users from replying to their comments. Click the ðŸ”¨ icon next to a reply to ban a user, or visit the <a href="/ban">moderation page</a> to view and manage your bans.<br><br>

Profile owners can disable replying for other users by going to <a href="/settings">settings</a> and unchecking "Allow replies from all".  After that, profile owners can still enable debates selectively by including the words 'debate me' in some of their belief card comments.<br>
